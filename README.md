A simple and cross-platform Python text editor.

This is an initial port of texteditor/textworker to use wxPython - not all features are implemented.

Stuffs you can do with this editor:
* Split tabs and rearrange them like VSCode (but it's a bit limited)
* Access to your files without opening File Explorer
* Run some tasks with Command Window
* Customizable interface
* Auto save! (for the current tab in this time)
